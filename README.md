# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography  

## 📌 Project Overview  
With increasing cybersecurity concerns, traditional encryption methods often draw attention. This project utilizes **Steganography** to securely hide sensitive data inside images without altering their appearance, making it an effective technique for secure communication.  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ Secure & undetectable data hiding  
✅ Simple and intuitive web-based GUI  
✅ Fast encoding & decoding process  
✅ Open-source & scalable for future improvements  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
**Frontend:** React.js (GUI) - Hosted on Vercel  
**Backend:** Spring Boot (API) - Hosted on Render  
**Image Processing:** OpenCV  
**Languages:** Java, JavaScript  
**Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)  

## 📌 How It Works  
1. **Encode:** Upload an image, enter a message, set a password, and generate a steganographed image.  
2. **Decode:** Upload the steganographed image, enter the password, and retrieve the hidden message.
